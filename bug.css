The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you make a mistake in the syntax, it can lead to unexpected results. For example, forgetting a space between the operator and the value can cause the calculation to fail.  Another issue is using units inconsistently.  Mixing percentages and pixels without proper understanding can lead to unpredictable layouts.
